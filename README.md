## Brock University Subreddit Chrome Extension  

This is an extension for Google Chrome that displays the latest links from the
Brock University subreddit, [/r/brocku](http://brocku.reddit.com).
It also features search, a link for submitting the url of the current tab and, optionally, desktop notifications of newly submitted stories.

This is one out of two projects I worked on during the [St. Catharines 2012 Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/216867181733366).

#### Possible Future Updates:
* Login / Logout
* Upvote / Downvote
* Configurable # of stories to show
* Ability to show the newest stories instead of the most popular
