This is an extension for Google Chrome that displays the latest links from the
Brock University subreddit, [/r/brocku](http://brocku.reddit.com).
You can also search, make a submission of the current page, and receive desktop notifications of newly submitted stories.

This is one out of two projects I worked on during the [St. Catharines 2012 Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/216867181733366).
