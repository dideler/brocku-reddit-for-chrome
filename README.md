## Brock University Subreddit Chrome Extension  

This is an extension for Google Chrome that displays the latest links from the Brock University subreddit [/r/brocku](http://brocku.reddit.com). It also features a link for submitting the url of the current tab and, optionally, desktop notifications of newly submitted stories.

This is one out of two projects I worked on during the [St. Catharines 2012 Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/216867181733366).

#### Possible Future Updates:
* Login / Logout
* Upvote / Downvote
* Configurable # of stories to show
* Ability to show the newest stories instead of the most popular

### Thank You
* [Adam Albrecht](http://www.adamalbrecht.com) for providing an awesome foundation I could build upon.
* [Collin Price](https://github.com/collinprice) & Ron Bond for keeping me company while hacking on their own project.
* [Katherine Bowler](https://github.com/Katbow) for bringing supplies to keep me energized.
* And everyone else who stopped by during the hackathon!
